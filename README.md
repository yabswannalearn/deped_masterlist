# DepEd School Masterlist Dashboard (S.Y. 2020-2021)

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive visualization of the Department of Education (DepEd) Masterlist of schools for the School Year 2020-2021. The primary goal is to analyze and present key insights into the distribution and characteristics of educational institutions across the Philippines. By leveraging a custom Python script for data extraction, data cleaning in Excel, and visualization capabilities in Power BI, this dashboard provides an at-a-glance understanding of the educational landscape.

## Data Source

The dataset used is the official **DepEd Masterlist of Schools for S.Y. 2020-2021**. It was sourced directly from the Department of Education's official website in PDF format.

- **Source:** Department of Education (DepEd)
    
- **Link:** [Masterlist of Schools S.Y. 2020-2021](https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SY-2020-2021-Masterlist-of-Schools-Address-only-1-1.pdf)
    

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Used to write a custom script for extracting data from the source PDF.
    
- **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for the data preparation phase, including cleaning, validation, and structuring.
    
- **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for creating the interactive dashboard, data modeling, and visualization.
    

## Methodology

The project was executed in three main stages:

### 1. Data Extraction (Python)

The source data was provided as a PDF document. A custom Python script was developed to parse this PDF file. The script successfully extracted the school masterlist data and converted it into a structured Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file, making it accessible for use in spreadsheet software.

### 2. Data Preparation (Excel)

The CSV file generated by the Python script was then imported into Microsoft Excel for processing. The key activities in this stage included:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting typographical errors, and standardizing naming conventions for regions, divisions, and other categorical data.
    
- **Data Validation:** Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data by checking for inconsistencies or anomalies.
    
- **Data Structuring:** Organizing the data into a clean, tabular format suitable for import into Power BI. Columns were formatted to their correct data types (e.g., text, numbers).
    

### 3. Data Visualization (Power BI)

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to build the dashboard. This involved:

- **Data Modeling:** Establishing relationships between different data tables (if necessary).
    
- **DAX Calculations:** Creating new measures and calculated columns to derive insights, such as the percentages for the distribution of schools by locale.
    
- **Dashboard Design:** Creating a series of charts and visuals to represent the data effectively. The final dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and insightful.
    

## Dashboard Overview & Key Insights

The dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of the school data, focusing on geographical distribution and locale differences.

### Overall Snapshot

- **Total Divisions:** The data is organized into 221 school divisions.
    

### Regional Distribution of Schools

The number of schools varies significantly across the regions.

- **Region IV-A (CALABARZON)** has the highest number of schools, with 5,060.
    
- **Region III (Central Luzon)** follows with 3,660 schools.
    
- The
    
    **Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR)** has the lowest count among the listed regions, with 1,280 schools.
    

### Top Divisions by School Count

The dashboard identifies the school divisions with the highest concentration of schools.

- **Iloilo** leads all divisions with 1,054 schools.
    
- Other top divisions include
    
    **Cebu** (904) ,
    
    **Batangas** (826) ,
    
    **Bohol** (804) , and
    
    **Quezon** (773).
    

### Analysis of School Locale

A significant finding is the distribution of schools based on their locale classification.

- A majority of schools,
    
    **73.72%** (30,640), are situated in **Partially Urban** areas.
    
- **Urban** areas contain **22.1%** (9,180) of the schools.
    
- **Rural** areas account for the smallest portion, with **4.18%** (1,740) of schools.
